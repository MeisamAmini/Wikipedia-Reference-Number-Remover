# Wikipedia Reference Number Remover #

## Usage ##

[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) is one of the best resources for knowledge on the internet, and we can use it to learn about almost everything. But when you read Wikipedia using a screen reader or a text to speech function like **Read Aloud** in Microsoft Edge, the frequent announcement of reference numbers is rather distracting.

This simple userscript designed for extensions like **TamperMonkey** removes all reference numbers from Wikipedia articles automatically in all languages. After installing it, you just visit Wikipedia like normal and you'll see that there are no reference numbers in articles anymore.

## Installation ##

There exist a few extensions like **TamperMonkey** which get installed on your browser and let you install small extensions written by users, or yourself, for that matter. So to use this userscript you need to install one of those extensions and then install the userscript itself.

First, install **TamperMonkey** extension for Google Chrome [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) and for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).

Then install the latest version of this userscript from [here](https://github.com/MeisamAmini/Wikipedia-Reference-Number-Remover/raw/main/wikipedia-reference-number-remover.user.js).
